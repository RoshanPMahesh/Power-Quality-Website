stuff to note down:
1. ta meetings
2. block diagrams/figma image from paper/images of website and database
3. meeting with group
4. what i worked on and when - use commit history to help
5. work i did with group for deadlines (presentations, papers, pcb deadlines)

# Roshan Mahesh's ECE 445 Lab Notebook

My name is Roshan Mahesh, and this is my lab notebook for ECE 445. This notebook will contain entries that cover TA meetings, meetings with my group, what I worked on and how I debugged certain features, and the work I did with my group for deadlines. There will also be block diagrams and images to accompany some entries to showcase progress.

# TA Meeting: March 20, 2024

- Going to submit PCB next Tuesday.
- Individual evaluation next week.
- Website construction has started, frontend more than halfway done - need to set up GCP and ESP32.
- Ordered more parts, nearing $100 though.
- Might not need LCD screen, redundant with website.
- Need to meet with machine shop to tell them we just need a box, or we just make it ourselves.

# TA Meeting: March 27, 2024

- Working on frontend, backend of website.
- Set up Google Cloud database, need to set up WebSocket.
- We aren’t using machine shop, we don’t think it’ll be complicated and won’t take up too much time.
- Ordered the first PCB, second PCB will be ordered next week.
- We will be working on the 2nd PCB, simulate first PCB and continue to look over it for errors.

# TA Meeting: April 3, 2024

- Both PCBs have been ordered. Not sure if we’ll get our PCBs in time to fix for the 5th order.
- Don’t need any more parts, all ordered.
- 80% done for website, able to connect ESP32 to WiFi and database. Just need to display charts.
- Need to do power supply unit before the demo since it takes time, can’t do in real-time.
- Everything else can be demoed/tested in real-time.
- Made PCB with lots of test points, should be able to debug easily.
- Mock demo coming up soon, final demo and final presentation could be combined into 1 - will know more later.

# TA Meeting: April 11, 2024

- Started putting components on PCB to make sure they fit.
- Started making the enclosure.
- Will start soldering this weekend.
- Tested the current transformer to make sure we are getting the right output current, which we are.
- Website just needs graphs and notifications now, ESP32 and database are set up.
- For the final demo, we have a plan for what we’re going to show but it’s more dependent on what we have done by the mock demo.
  - Surya said he’s fine with the plan.
- Didn’t need 5th PCB round order.

# TA Meeting: April 17, 2024

- Presented introduction, high-level requirements, what works, and what doesn’t work yet.
- Explained the work we have left and our plans to complete the project.
- Asked questions about the enclosure and things to expect for the final demo.
  - We’ll need a strict enclosure that has a high voltage warning sticker, and we’ll need to bring printouts of our high-level requirement and other items.
- Not able to have the website working on Illinois WiFi due to security constraints on the WiFi. My hotspot isn’t strong enough to connect either.
  - Will need to figure this out by the final demo.
- Surya is overall happy with the progress, especially compared to the state of the project a week ago.
